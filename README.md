Things to do continue next:

x shorter reg names, reg-pair -> Cpu
x better print format for disassembler
x show computed decode table at startup, check dups!

- rest of used instruction decoding
x MVI, location: Reg/M

x count ticks
x instruction know how their ticks

x missing regs
- condition flags
- rest of used instruction semantics
- conditional effect

- interrupt handling
x count frames
- visualization

- compilation
